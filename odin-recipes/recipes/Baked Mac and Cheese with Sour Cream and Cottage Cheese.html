    <h2>How to Make Mac & Cheese</h2>
    <p>This macaroni and cheese with sour cream and cottage cheese is rich and cheesy but not too dry. My family loves this, and we have it for all our big meals.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages mild Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/2 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix together remaining mild Cheddar cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, and egg in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir cooked macaroni into cheese mixture. Pour macaroni mixture into the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with reserved 1/2 cup mild Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        
    </ol>
